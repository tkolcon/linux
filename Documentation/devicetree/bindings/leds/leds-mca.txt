Digi ConnectCore SOMs Micro Controller Assist LEDs controller

Required properties:
  - compatible: 	must be "digi,mca-led"
  - #address-cells:	must be 1.
  - #size-cells:	must be 0.

Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the mca_led device.

LED sub-node required properties:
  - reg:	index of the MCA LED controller.
  - io:		MCA IO the LED is connected to.

LED sub-node optional properties:
  - label:		    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - active-low:		    Boolean, makes LED active low.
  - linux,default-trigger:  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - led-pattern:	    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - retain-state-suspended: The LED retains configured functionality during suspend.
			    Only applies to some triggers like default-on, timer.
  - retain-state-shutdown:  Retain the state of the LED on shutdown.
  - panic-indicator: 	    see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Examples:
mca_led: led {
	compatible = "digi,mca-led";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	led0: led@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		label = "power:green";
		io = <13>;
		linux,default-trigger = "default-on";
	};

	led1: led@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		label = "USER_LED1:green";
		io = <12>;
		/* Configure it to blink at boot as an example */
		linux,default-trigger = "timer";
		led-pattern = <100>, <1000>;
		retain-state-suspended;
	};

	led2: led@2 {
		reg = <2>;
		label = "USER_LED2:orange";
		io = <18>;
		/* Configure it to blink at boot as an example */
		linux,default-trigger = "timer";
		led-pattern = <5000>, <5000>;
		retain-state-suspended;
	};
};
