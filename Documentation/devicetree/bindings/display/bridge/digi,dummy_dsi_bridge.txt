Digi dummy MIPI-DSI bridge bindings

The MIPI-DSI host controller drives the video signals from
display controller to video peripherals using DSI protocol.
This is an un-managed DSI bridge. In order to use this bridge, an encoder
or bridge must be implemented to manage the platform specific initializations.

Required properties:
- compatible: 		"digi,dummy_dsi_bridge"
- port: 		input port node with endpoint definition as
			defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt;
			the input port should be connected to a MIPI-DSI device
			driver

Optional properties:
- dsi-lanes:		number of DSI lanes to be used. Must be <1> to <4>.
			Default value is <4>.
- video-mode		video data transfer mode. Must be <0> or <1> as follows:
			    <0>: Video burst mode
			    <1>: Video pulse mode
			Default value is <1>.
- display-timings:	timings for the connected panel according to [1]

Example:
	dummy_dsi_bridge {
		compatible = "digi,dummy_dsi_bridge";
		dsi-lanes = <4>;
		video-mode = <1>;
		status = "okay";

		display-timings {
			native-mode = <&display>;

			display: timing@0 {
				clock-frequency = <31500000>;
				hactive = <640>;
				vactive = <480>;
				hback-porch = <4>;
				hfront-porch = <10>;
				vback-porch = <34>;
				vfront-porch = <20>;
				hsync-len = <2>;
				vsync-len = <2>;
				hsync-active = <0>;
				vsync-active = <0>;
				de-active = <0>;
				pixelclk-active = <0>;
			};
		};
		port {
			dummy_dsi_bridge_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&mipi_dsi_out>;
			};
		};
	};
