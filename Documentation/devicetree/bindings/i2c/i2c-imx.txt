* Freescale Inter IC (I2C) and High Speed Inter IC (HS-I2C) for i.MX

Required properties:
- compatible :
  - "fsl,imx1-i2c" for I2C compatible with the one integrated on i.MX1 SoC
  - "fsl,imx21-i2c" for I2C compatible with the one integrated on i.MX21 SoC
  - "fsl,vf610-i2c" for I2C compatible with the one integrated on Vybrid vf610 SoC
- reg : Should contain I2C/HS-I2C registers location and length
- interrupts : Should contain I2C/HS-I2C interrupt
- clocks : Should contain the I2C/HS-I2C clock specifier

Optional properties:
- clock-frequency : Constains desired I2C/HS-I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.
  The absence of the property indicates the default frequency 100 kHz.
- dmas: A list of two dma specifiers, one for each entry in dma-names.
- dma-names: should contain "tx" and "rx".
- scl-gpios: specify the gpio related to SCL pin
- sda-gpios: specify the gpio related to SDA pin
- pinctrl: add extra pinctrl to configure i2c pins to gpio function for i2c
  bus recovery, call it "gpio" state
- digi,atecc508a-workaround : ATECC508A cryptochip produces an sporadic unexpected
  behavior on the i2c bus when sharing the bus with other peripherals at a bus
  speed lower than 300KHz.
  This property enables a workaround suggested by the chip manufacturer (Microchip):
     1- Wake the cryptochip device before communication with the other devices on
        the system bus.
     2- Upon completion of communication with the other device a cryptochip Sleep
        command should be issued. (This is to put the device into a known state if
        it did actually wake up).
- digi,atecc508a-address : ATECC508A bus slave address (7 bits). If not present,
  the default ATECC508A slave address 0x60 is used.
- digi,atecc508a-awake-delay-uS : Delay in micro seconds since awake command until
  communication with other devices. If not present, no delay is done.
- digi,atecc508a-sleep-delay-uS : Delay in micro seconds since awake command until
  sleep command. This delay is used to assure the cryptochip is awake when the
  sleep command is sent. If not present, no delay is done.
